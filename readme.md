# Go-DOM

HTML DOM Parser for Go. With this, Go can access and change all the elements of an HTML document.
Unlike [GopherJS](https://github.com/gopherjs/gopherjs), this doesn't interact directly with the DOM nor javascript.
This can only be used to edit, delete, add elements in the document and then convert it back to HTML.
Also unlike [Goquery](https://github.com/PuerkitoBio/goquery), this maps the javascript methods 1:1.
